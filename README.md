## Sid Allocation Working Group

The goal of this project is to create a vendor-neutral working group that defines and documents the signature ID ranges for anyone developing Suricata signatures. 

Our goal is to improve the experience of users who might be utilizing different rulesets by avoiding any overlaps in the signature IDs.

## Adding/Removing Ranges

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/sidallocation/sidallocation.org/issues) with additional information. 

## Fixing overlaps

It's still the responsability of the ruleset maintainer to adhere to the [allocation table](https://sidallocation.org), so any problems should first be brought up to the maintainer. Additionally, you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/sidallocation/sidallocation.org/issues) in case you need assistance.
